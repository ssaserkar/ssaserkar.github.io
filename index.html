      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Autonomous Dynamic Obstacle Navigation in ROS Husky</h3>
          <p>Developed and implemented global planners, including OP-PRM, RRTx, and Risk-DTRRT, using ROS and C++. Integrated local planners, DWA and TEB from the Husky Local Planner. Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the robustness and accuracy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Panoptic Segmentation on 3D LiDAR Point Cloud Data</h3>
          <p>Converted the 3D Point Cloud Image to 2D Spherical Projection to reduce dimensionality. Utilized the encoder-decoder of the RangeNet++ Architecture to obtain relevant feature maps. Remodeled the Semantic Head of RangeNet++ for Semantic Segmentation, and used Mask-RCNN for Instance Segmentation. Implemented the Panoptic Head, having features of Mask Matching and Mask Removal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Automating the Endoscope Camera of the DVRK</h3>
          <p>Automated the Endoscope camera for the daVinci Research Kit, tracked gaze within Unity3D. Performed Semantic Segmentation on the CholecSeg8k using the UNet++ Architecture. Achieved an overall accuracy of 68% and reduced training time by using the pretrained resnet18
weights. Region of Interest within the surgical frame by using the semantically segmented image.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Development of a Delta Wing Glider prototype as a payload</h3>
      <p>Mentored a team of 10 to develop a delta-wing glider as a payload to deploy from a can-sized satellite for CANSAT 2020. Developed an active feedback sensor-actuator interface for ailerons to maintain a tilt of 3Â° and a helical trajectory of 250m. Ranked 53rd globally and came in the 88th percentile.</p>
